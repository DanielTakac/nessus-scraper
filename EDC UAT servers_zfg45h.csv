occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

credentials. No issues were reported with access, privilege, or
intermittent failure.","Valid credentials were provided for an authentication protocol on the
remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

prior to 15.6. It is, therefore, affected by following vulnerability:

  - Late privilege drop in REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY in PostgreSQL allows an object creator to
    execute arbitrary SQL functions as the command issuer. The command intends to run SQL functions as the
    owner of the materialized view, enabling safe refresh of untrusted materialized views. The victim is a
    superuser or member of one of the attacker's roles. The attack requires luring the victim into running
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY on the attacker's materialized view. As part of exploiting this
    vulnerability, the attacker creates functions that use CREATE RULE to convert the internally-built
    temporary table to a view. Versions before PostgreSQL 15.6, 14.11, 13.14, and 12.18 are affected. The only
    known exploit does not work in PostgreSQL 16 and later. For defense in depth, PostgreSQL 16.2 adds the
    protections that older branches are using to fix their vulnerability. (CVE-2024-0985)

  - Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache
    Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers

    infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed. This issue

  - Incorrect control of environment variables in PostgreSQL PL/Perl allows an unprivileged database user to
    change sensitive process environment variables (e.g. PATH). That often suffices to enable arbitrary code

  - Incorrect privilege assignment in PostgreSQL allows a less-privileged application user to view or change
    different rows from those intended. An attack requires the application to use SET ROLE, SET SESSION
    AUTHORIZATION, or an equivalent feature. The problem arises when an application query uses parameters from
    the attacker or conveys query results to the attacker. If that query reacts to current_setting('role') or
    the current user ID, it may modify or return data as though the session had not used SET ROLE or SET
    SESSION AUTHORIZATION. The attacker does not control which incorrect user ID applies. Query text from
    less-privileged sources is not a concern here, because SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION are not
    sandboxes for unvetted queries. (CVE-2024-10978)

  - Client use of server error message in PostgreSQL allows a server not trusted under current SSL or GSS
    settings to furnish arbitrary non-NUL bytes to the libpq application. For example, a man-in-the-middle

execution vulnerability as referenced in the ZDI-24-1532 advisory.

  - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of 7-Zip.
    Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary 
    depending on the implementation. The specific flaw exists within the implementation of Zstandard 
    decompression. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can
    result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to 
    execute code in the context of the current process. (CVE-2024-11477)

  - Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. This issue affects
    Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through
    9.0.97. The mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete. Users running Tomcat on a case insensitive file
    system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation parameter set to the non-default
    value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which
    version of Java they are using with Tomcat: - running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property
    sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true) - running on Java 17: the
    system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false (it defaults to false) - running on
    Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required (the system property and the problematic cache have
    been removed) Tomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that sun.io.useCanonCaches is
    set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file
    system. Tomcat will also set sun.io.useCanonCaches to false by default where it can. (CVE-2024-56337)

  - Improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL libpq functions PQescapeLiteral(),
    PQescapeIdentifier(), PQescapeString(), and PQescapeStringConn() allows a database input provider to
    achieve SQL injection in certain usage patterns. Specifically, SQL injection requires the application to
    use the function result to construct input to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. Similarly,
    improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL command line utility programs allows a source of

  - Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When using
    PreResources or PostResources mounted other than at the root of the web application, it was possible to
    access those resources via an unexpected path. That path was likely not to be protected by the same

  - Untrusted Search Path vulnerability in Apache Tomcat installer for Windows. During installation, the
    Tomcat installer for Windows used icacls.exe without specifying a full path. This issue affects Apache
    Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.23 through 9.0.105. The
    following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 through
    8.5.100 and 7.0.95 through 7.0.109. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or
    9.0.106, which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-49124)

  - Session Fixation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat via rewrite valve. This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from
    11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105. Older, EOL
    versions may also be affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106,
    which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-55668)

  - Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When using
    PreResources or PostResources mounted other than at the root of the web application, it was possible to
    access those resources via an unexpected path. That path was likely not to be protected by the same
    security constraints as the expected path, allowing those security constraints to be bypassed. This issue
    affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1
    through 9.0.105. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be
    affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected. Users are recommended to
    upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-49125)

  - Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. This issue affects
    Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through
    9.0.105. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected:
    8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to
    version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-48988)

  - Allocation of resources for multipart headers with insufficient limits enabled a DoS vulnerability in
    Apache Commons FileUpload. This issue affects Apache Commons FileUpload: from 1.0 before 1.6; from
    2.0.0-M1 before 2.0.0-M4. Users are recommended to upgrade to versions 1.6 or 2.0.0-M4, which fix the
    issue. (CVE-2025-48976)

It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the fixed_in_apache_tomcat_10.1.42_security-10 advisory.

  - Untrusted Search Path vulnerability in Apache Tomcat installer for Windows. During installation, the
    Tomcat installer for Windows used icacls.exe without specifying a full path. This issue affects Apache
    Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.23 through 9.0.105. The
    following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 through
    8.5.100 and 7.0.95 through 7.0.109. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or
    9.0.106, which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-49124)

  - Session Fixation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat via rewrite valve. This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from
    11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105. Older, EOL
    versions may also be affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106,
    which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-55668)

  - Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When using
    PreResources or PostResources mounted other than at the root of the web application, it was possible to
    access those resources via an unexpected path. That path was likely not to be protected by the same
    security constraints as the expected path, allowing those security constraints to be bypassed. This issue
    affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1
    through 9.0.105. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be
    affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected. Users are recommended to
    upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-49125)

  - Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. This issue affects
    Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through
    9.0.105. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected:
    8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to
    version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-48988)

  - Allocation of resources for multipart headers with insufficient limits enabled a DoS vulnerability in
    Apache Commons FileUpload. This issue affects Apache Commons FileUpload: from 1.0 before 1.6; from
    2.0.0-M1 before 2.0.0-M4. Users are recommended to upgrade to versions 1.6 or 2.0.0-M4, which fix the
    issue. (CVE-2025-48976)

  - Notepad++ is a free and open-source source code editor. In versions 8.8.1 and prior, a privilege escalation
    vulnerability exists in the Notepad++ v8.8.1 installer that allows unprivileged users to gain SYSTEM-level

    trick users into downloading both the legitimate installer and a malicious executable to the same directory
    (typically Downloads folder - which is known as Vulnerable directory). Upon running the installer, the attack
    executes automatically with SYSTEM privileges. This issue has been fixed and will be released in version 8.8.2.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

credentials. No issues were reported with access, privilege, or
intermittent failure.","Valid credentials were provided for an authentication protocol on the
remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","

vulnerabilities as referenced in the fixed_in_apache_tomcat_10.1.25_security-10 advisory.

  - Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache
    Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers
    correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect
    infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed. This issue
    affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1

    issue. (CVE-2024-34750)

  - Tomcat, under certain configurations on any platform, allows an attacker to cause an OutOfMemoryError

execution vulnerability as referenced in the ZDI-24-1532 advisory.

  - This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of 7-Zip.
    Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary 
    depending on the implementation. The specific flaw exists within the implementation of Zstandard 
    decompression. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can
    result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to 
    execute code in the context of the current process. (CVE-2024-11477)

  - Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability during JSP compilation in Apache Tomcat
    permits an RCE on case insensitive file systems when the default servlet is enabled for write (non-default
    configuration). This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through
    10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.2, 10.1.34 or
    9.0.98, which fixes the issue. (CVE-2024-50379)

  - Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. This issue affects
    Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through
    9.0.97. The mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete. Users running Tomcat on a case insensitive file
    system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation parameter set to the non-default
    value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which
    version of Java they are using with Tomcat: - running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property
    sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true) - running on Java 17: the
    system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false (it defaults to false) - running on
    Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required (the system property and the problematic cache have
    been removed) Tomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that sun.io.useCanonCaches is
    set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file
    system. Tomcat will also set sun.io.useCanonCaches to false by default where it can. (CVE-2024-56337)

  - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the examples web application provided with Apache
    Tomcat leads to denial of service. This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from
    10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.9.97. Users are recommended to upgrade to version
